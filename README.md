**CO2 Emissions Prediction with Hyperparameter Tuning and SHAP Analysis**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to predict CO2 emissions from vehicles using various features like engine size, fuel consumption, etc. The project uses a machine learning pipeline that includes preprocessing steps and an XGBoost model.

Optuna is used for hyperparameter optimization of the XGBoost model.

The model is evaluated using k-fold cross-validation.
 
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret the model's predictions. This gives insights into which features are most important for predicting CO2 emissions.
